1. We used weather Dataset which is available on Kaggle and downloaded the dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-weather-events).
2. Load the dataset in jupyter lab as weather.csv file.
3. Load the file and run it in jupyter terminal using the command streamlit run filename.py
4. It would direct you to window displaying the output of the streamlit app(Takes alot of time to execute as weather datset is too large).
